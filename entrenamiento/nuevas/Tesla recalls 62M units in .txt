The China State Administration for Market Regulation revealed Friday that electric automaker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will recall 1.62 million vehicles in the country. The recall follows two others that were enacted in the United States in December.
The U.S. automaker will release an over-the-air software update on the vehicles to fix glitches with the vehicle’s automatic assisted steering and door lock controls. According to the regulator, the defect increases the risk of vehicle collisions by potentially allowing drivers to "misuse" the Autopilot functions.
Effected vehicles include the company’s models S, X, 3 and Y in China made between 2014 to 2023.
In the U.S., Tesla recalled more than 2 million vehicles to update safety measures in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system in response to safety concerns raised by a federal regulator.
Additionally, the company recalled slightly more than 120,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the US due to the potential risk of doors becoming unlocked and opening in the event of a crash.
Shares of TSLA are down 0.79% in pre-market trading Friday morning.
