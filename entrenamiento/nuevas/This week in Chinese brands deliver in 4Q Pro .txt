GM foots the bill
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced on Wednesday its decision to offer incentives amounting to $7,500 on its electric vehicles, despite the recent loss of a U.S. government tax credit. This move comes after the Treasury released guidelines in December aimed at reshaping the EV supply chain in the U.S. by imposing new battery sourcing requirements to decrease dependence on China. These guidelines took effect this Monday.
GM communicated to its dealers that it would compensate the equivalent EV tax credit amount "for any vehicles that became ineligible due to the new guidelines." Last month, GM revealed that all its EVs, except for the Chevrolet Bolt, would temporarily lose eligibility for the tax credit. They specifically highlighted that the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EVs faced ineligibility due to issues associated with two minor components.
Anticipating modifications in sourcing, GM expects the Lyriq and Blazer EVs to regain eligibility in early 2024. Additionally, they clarified that vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac OPTIQ, manufactured "after the sourcing change," will qualify for the full incentive.
Similarly, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced last month that its E-Transit and Mach-E models would no longer qualify for the $3,750 tax credit. However, the F-150 EV Lightning pickup truck and the Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring SUV retained their tax credits.
Ford disclosed its plans on Wednesday to increase the prices of its entry-level F-150 EVs by $5,000 to $10,000 while reducing prices for select premium models by up to $7,000.
Shares of GM ended trading down 1.18% for the week after dropping more than 2.4% on Tuesday.
Fisker's deals with dealerships
Emerging American electric automaker, Fisker Inc (NYSE:FSR) announced this week its plans to develop an innovative Dealer Partnership model in North America. The company aims to create a distinctive hybrid approach combining direct sales and dealer arrangements, marking a new direction for Fisker's market strategy.
CEO, Henrik Fisker, revealed in a press release that Fisker is targeting the addition of "as many as 50 dealer partners in the US and Canada, alongside a similar number of dealer locations in Europe" during 2024.
This Dealer Partnership model seeks to offer Fisker customers fixed pricing (where regulations allow) while also granting dealer partners broader market territories, allowing them to establish pricing without local competition constraints. Since late November 2023, the company has been in talks with several potential dealers to initiate this model.
Fisker envisions this strategy as a catalyst for boosting the growth of its sales, delivery, and test drive network. The company aims to have its initial dealers receiving vehicles by the end of Q1 2024 and intends to finalize all initial dealer partnerships before introducing higher-volume vehicle models.
Shares of FSR ended trading on Friday down 25.2% for the week.
