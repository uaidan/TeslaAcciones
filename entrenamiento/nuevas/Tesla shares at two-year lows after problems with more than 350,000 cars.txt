Tesla has recalled a total of 350,976 vehicles in the United States (US) for lighting and airbag problems that may affect the safety of occupants, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency of the United States (NHTSA, for its acronym in English). Last Friday it became known that the company would have to review some vehicles, but it was not until Monday that the exact figure was revealed. Following the news, the company's shares fell 6.84% at the close of trading on Wall Street, to 167.87 dollars, hitting a two-year low.
As for the problem with the lighting, which affects 321,628 units of Tesla Model 3 and Model Y manufactured from 2020, the US agency has reported that, "on rare occasions," the taillights on one or both sides of the vehicle "may illuminate intermittently due to a firmware anomaly," while the brake lights, reverse lights and turn signals are not affected. In that regard, NHTSA warns that an intermittently illuminating taillight can reduce visibility in poor lighting conditions, which can "increase the risk of a collision." To address this issue, Tesla will implement an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update for affected models, a procedure that will be at no cost to the customer. Problems with the airbag Meanwhile, the problem with the airbag affects 29,348 units of Tesla Model X manufactured from 2021 and has to do with the restraint control module (RCM, for its acronym in English), which affects the calibration of the system and can cause the front airbag to "deploy in an undesired configuration" in low-speed collisions, thereby increasing the risk of injury, according to the NHTSA. To address this issue, the company will also implement a free 'over-the-air' firmware update to adjust the system's calibration.
