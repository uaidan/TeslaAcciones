The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced Tuesday that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be recalling 54,676 Model X vehicles produced from 2021 to 2023 due to a potential issue with the vehicle controller, which may not properly detect low brake fluid and subsequently fail to illuminate a warning light.
According to the NHTSA, Tesla has issued a cost-free over-the-air (OTA) software update to address the problem.
As of October 10, Tesla has reported no incidents of crashes, injuries, or fatalities associated with this issue, the regulatory body stated.
In August, the NHTSA started investigating 280,000 new Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles following accounts of potential loss of steering control and power steering.
Shares of TSLA are down 1.17% in early trading Tuesday morning.
