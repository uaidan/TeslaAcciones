Tesla on Wednesday presented its results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2023, a period in which it posted a profit of $2.513 billion, down 24% from the $3.318 billion reaped in the same period of 2022. Earnings were $0.85 per share, in line with market expectations. The firm's shares fell 9.75% on Wall Street.
The group posted revenues for the period of 23,329 million, up 24% year-on-year, most of which came from the automotive division (19,963 million, +18%), while the power generation and services divisions contributed 1,529 million and 1,837 million, respectively.
Operating income reached 4,267 million, after posting a 15% drop over the past 12 months, while the Ebitda margin stood at 18.3%, down from 26.8% in the initial quarter of 2022.
"Although we implemented price reductions across many vehicle models in all regions in the first quarter, our operating margins declined at a manageable pace. We expect continued reductions in our vehicle costs, including improved production efficiencies at our newer factories and lower logistics costs," the firm has highlighted.
He also noted that the Cybertruck model is "on track" as Alpha versions are in production, while the Model Y was the "best-selling vehicle" in Europe and the United States throughout the first quarter.
"Cybertruck remains on track to begin production later this year at Gigafactory Texas. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next-generation platform," he says.
The firm delivered a total of 422,875 vehicles in the period, up 36% year-over-year, while new unit production grew 44% to 440,808.
"In the first quarter, we produced a record number of vehicles, thanks to ongoing ramp-ups at our factories in Austin and Berlin. We remain committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month and smoothing deliveries throughout the quarter, which will help reduce cost per vehicle while increasing in-transit inventory at the end of each quarter," adds
In the period, Tesla's factory in Shanghai "has been successfully running near full capacity," so it does not expect "a significant increase in the weekly production rate."
