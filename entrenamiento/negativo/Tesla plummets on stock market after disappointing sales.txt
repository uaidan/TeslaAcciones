Tesla has released its business results for the third quarter of 2023, a period in which the company reported a net profit of $1.853 billion, down 44% compared to $3.292 billion for the same period last year.
This translates into earnings per share of 0.66 cents, down from 0.95 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022 and 0.73 cents expected by the consensus.
Following the release of the earnings report, Tesla shares are down 9.30% on Wall Street. The price cut made by Elon Musk's company has weighed down the results.
In terms of revenue, the electric car manufacturer reported a figure of $23.35 billion, below the anticipated $24.1 billion. The figure, however, was better than the 21.454 billion in the same period of the previous year, representing a growth of 9%.
Of the total revenue, $19.625 billion was from auto sales, representing a year-on-year increase of 5%, as the entity recorded $18.692 billion in vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2022.
Tesla also reported 435,059 car deliveries for the period ended September 30, showing a 27% increase over the same quarter last year.
In this regard, Model S/X production was down 31% to 13,688 units, while Model 3/Y production reached 416,800, up 20%.
Adjusted Ebitda fell 24% to 3,758 million and Ebitda margin was set at 16.1%, down from 23.2% in Q1 2022.
"Our main objectives remained unchanged in Q3 2023: reducing cost per vehicle, free cash flow generation while maximizing delivery volumes and continued investment in AI and other growth projects," the company explained.
It also added that "in a high interest rate environment, we believe that focusing on R&D investments and capital expenditures for future growth while maintaining positive free cash flow is the right approach."
