Tesla accumulates new delays in the launch of its new vehicles. In fact, there is no confirmed date for any of the products pending to reach the market. Thus, it is not known when we will be able to see the Cybertruck pickup, the Semi truck or the Roadster sports car on the roads. Not to mention the "low cost" electric model that Elon Musk wanted to start producing in 2023 to be sold for less than $25,000.
All forecasts have been dashed once again. We say again because previously the American firm has already had problems to meet the deadlines set in the calendar. The best proof is that, according to Tesla's initial estimates, the three vehicles should already be rolling off the production line, something that will not happen imminently. This time, the main reason for the new delay lies in the microchip crisis, which is causing major production problems in the automotive sector. The lack of semiconductors is preventing the completion of vehicle production.
Given this situation, which is dragging on, Elon Musk has decided to temporarily halt the launch of new products. This was announced a few days ago when he presented the company's 2021 financial results. "If we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle production would decrease. Bringing out the Cybertruck, the Semi or the Roadster in 2022 would not make any sense because we will continue to have parts constraints," admitted the CEO of the company, which ended the year with a net profit of $5,519 million (equivalent to about 4,927 million euros).
