Auto giant Tesla experienced a significant drop in the value of its shares, losing as much as 8% after third-quarter results that disappointed investors. Now in pre-opening trading, its shares are down 4.91%.
The company's adjusted earnings came in at 66 cents per share, below market expectations, which expected 73 cents, and significantly less than the $1.05 in the same period last year.
Despite a 9% increase in revenue to $23.35 billion, these results fell short of estimates of $24.1 billion, marking the slowest pace of growth in more than three years for the company.
One of the factors that contributed to this drop in Tesla's earnings was its face-off with competition from Chinese automakers. To compete with cheap exports from China, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was forced to cut prices, which negatively impacted the company's profitability. The company's gross margin fell from 25.1% to 17.9% in the last quarter due to these price cuts.
This change in Tesla's profitability is particularly notable given that Elon Musk had previously claimed that the company was resilient to economic downturns. Tesla's stock plunge reached levels not seen since late August.
In addition to financial difficulties, Tesla faces concerns about the recall of nearly 55,000 vehicles due to problems with the brake fluid detector, which failed to detect low brake fluid. Although the company released a software update to fix the problem, this situation represents another challenge for the company in the midst of its disappointing quarter. The company continues to prepare for delivery of its Cybertruck model later this year, but investors are watching Tesla's next moves and Elon Musk's decisions amid an uncertain economic outlook. Tesla faces a number of financial and technical challenges after a disappointing third quarter that has led to a significant drop in the value of its stock. The market is closely watching the company's decisions and its ability to overcome these obstacles in the coming quarters.
