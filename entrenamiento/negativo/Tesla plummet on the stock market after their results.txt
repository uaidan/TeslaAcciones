Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and streaming content platform Netflix are down 9.7% and 8.4% on the stock market, respectively, due to falling margins and missed forecasts in the second quarter of the year.
Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and streaming content platform Netflix, world leaders in their respective sectors and two of the largest companies in the U.S., suffered severe punishment on the stock market on Thursday after presenting their quarterly results the day before. At the close, Tesla shares were down 9.74% at $262.9, while Netflix shares fell 8.4% to $437.4.
In the case of Tesla, the group led by Elon Musk raised profits by 20% between April and June, to 2,703 million dollars (2,410 million euros), but the company reduced margins by price cuts launched at the beginning of the year to boost sales.
The company, which has cut prices on its models by between 14% and 28% in the US this year - in other markets the discounts are similar - closed the period with a gross margin of 18% in its automotive business, the lowest since the end of 2017. In the first half of the year, Tesla reduced profits by 6.5% to $5.216 billion due to price cuts.
The group indicated that further rebates are likely to be available to spur demand against rivals such as Ford, which have entered a bidding war in the electric segment.
This announcement, which will continue to dent Tesla's profitability in the second half of the year, coupled with lower production in the third to upgrade its gigafactories over the summer, weighed on investor sentiment. Tesla's share price closed down 9.4% on Wall Street Thursday, even though the company has more than doubled its valuation so far this year. However, the stock is still slightly below the level of twelve months ago after the sharp decline it suffered in the final stretch of 2022. Its capitalization is currently around $824 billion.
