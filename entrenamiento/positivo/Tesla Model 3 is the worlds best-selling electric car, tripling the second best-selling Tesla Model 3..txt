The Tesla Model 3 was the world's best-selling electric car in 2019, and it was also with resounding authority. Gone are the days when the Nissan LEAF was the most popular electric car on the market; Tesla's small sedan has burst onto the market establishing itself as the preferred alternative for the majority who opt for an electric car. Last 2019, just over 301,000 units of the Tesla Model 3 were sold, a figure almost three times higher than that of the second-ranked model.
In the second position of the best-selling electric cars is the BAIC EU5, an electric sedan currently only sold in China. The Asian model managed to sell 111,000 units. Behind it, in third position we find the Nissan LEAF with 70,000 units sold during 2019. It is followed by another Chinese model: the BYD Yuan (or S2 EV), which managed to place 68,000 copies on the market.
One fact is striking: the Tesla Model 3 not only almost triples in sales the next in the ranking, but also outsold the BAIC EU5, the Nissan Leaf and the BYD Yuan combined. When compared to the next best-selling model in Europe and the United States (the LEAF), the Model 3 more than quadrupled the sales of Nissan's electric car.
What 2020 will hold for the Tesla Model 3 is an unknown; some analysts say demand will slow down, while others are of the opposite opinion. The launch of "Total Autonomous Driving" in the United States will stimulate demand in its home country, even with the arrival of the Model Y, and production at the Gigafactory 3 in China has only just begun.
Last year Tesla sold more than 367,000 cars in total, a record number for the company. In the last quarter of 2019 they produced 87,000 Model 3 units, so if they maintain a similar pace, they could end 2020 selling 350,000 Model 3s alone. However, that figure is presumably even higher as the pace of production at the Chinese Gigafactory increases.
