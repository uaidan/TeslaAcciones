The Tesla Model Y continues to lead European registrations so far this year, with 169,420 units through August and 21,549 vehicles (up 208%) in the eighth month. Thus, this electric car aims to be the best-selling model by the end of 2023, according to estimates by the consulting firm Jato Dynamics. This leadership is challenged by the Volkswagen T-Roc, which accumulated 145,131 units (up 19%) sold through the eighth month of the year, and the Peugeot 208, with 135,187 sales in the cumulative, 5% less than in the same period a year ago.
"Model Y is likely to become the best-selling passenger vehicle by the end of the year. As a non-European model, it will be a historic moment," noted Jato global analyst Felipe Munoz. In this regard, registrations of 100% electric vehicles accounted for 22% of total registrations in the eighth month of the year, with 196,000 units of the nearly 900,000 registered in August, up 20% compared to the same month in 2022, while the volume of electric cars increased by 102%. Meanwhile, sales of gasoline vehicles increased by 11%, and continue to account for more than half (53%) of new registrations.
Thus, the biggest beneficiaries of the boom in electric vehicles are Tesla and the Chinese MG, which has registered its second largest market share, both in the general market, surpassing brands such as Jeep, Mazda, Mini or Suzuki, and in the 100% electric market, where it has registered more cars than Audi, Opel, Peugeot or Renault. Up to August, MG accounted for 69% of the 197,800 registrations of Chinese brands. Munoz stressed that the consultant's data show that the growth in demand for electric cars "continues to be strong" because their prices are "increasingly competitive", despite the debates that point to a slowdown in this segment.
By brands, Germany's Volkswagen was the best-selling in Europe in the eighth month of the year, with 99,266 units, 10% more than in 2022, followed by Toyota, which grew by 12% to 59,132 cars sold. Rounding out the podium was BMW, which added 53,334 registrations, up 21% from a year ago. Audi and Skoda completed the top five for the month, with 51,132 and 49,996 sales, respectively. The top ten was completed by Mercedes, Peugeot, Renault, Kia and Hyundai. In terms of growth compared to August 2022, Tesla and MG were the top performers, up 240% (33,809 units) and 169% (14,887 units), while third was Jeep, up 93% to 8,091 units registered in Europe in the eighth month of the year.
