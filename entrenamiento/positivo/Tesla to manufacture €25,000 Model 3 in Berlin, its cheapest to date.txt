U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla is planning to manufacture at its plant near Berlin a new model at a price of 25,000 euros, an anonymous source has assured Reuters.
According to this information, the company's CEO, Elon Musk, informed the staff of the gigafactory in Grünheide (Germany) about the company's plans, although the production start date has not been specified.
For years now, Musk has been talking about making electric vehicles more affordable for the entire public, both in 2018 and 2020, but a year ago he assured that they had not yet mastered the technology to make costs lower.
In this sense, Tesla's German factory has a technology called "giga-press" that can allow making electric vehicles more economically by reducing parts, such as getting to melt almost all the underbody of the vehicle in one piece, which would speed up production and reduce costs.
Currently, the cheapest vehicle of the American company is the Model 3, priced from 42,990 euros, a price that in Spain could take advantage of the aid of the Moves III Plan, up to 10,000 euros and the 15% deduction of personal income tax.
Likewise, another vehicle manufactured at its Berlin plant, the Model Y, has become the 'top seller' in Europe so far this year, with 198,730 units through September, according to data from the consulting firm Jato Dynamics, leading to expectations that it will be the best-selling car in the Old Continent at the end of the year, the first time a vehicle of non-European origin has won this accolade.
Tesla also informed workers last Friday that all staff would receive a 4% pay rise from November, and production workers will receive an additional €2,500 a year from February 2024, equivalent to an 18% pay rise in a year and a half.
