The S&P 500 index, reflecting the performance of 500 publicly owned companies, closed last Friday near support at 4,328 with resistance at 4,380. Despite a sell-off triggered by the Israel-Gaza conflict causing a surge in oil prices and US Treasuries, the index gained 0.45% last week. This gain was buoyed by robust earnings from leading banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo.
Noted bear Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley sees few reasons for a fourth-quarter rally for the S&P 500. The index is influenced by the aggregate performance of its constituent companies, US and global macroeconomic data, interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, inflation, and other metrics impacting Fed decisions.
