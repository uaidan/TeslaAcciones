In a major move in the world of electric mobility, Honda has confirmed that it will adopt Tesla's charging standard, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). Tesla established this standard as official and open in November of last year.
While Honda executives had previously announced their intention to adopt Tesla's charging port in August, and have now provided specific details on when and how this transition will take place. According to a press release issued by the Japanese automaker, its electric models going on sale in North America starting in 2025 will use the NACS standard. This change will begin with the launch of a new electric vehicle model that Honda plans to introduce to the market that same year.
Importantly, Honda models introduced before 2025 that are equipped with CCS (Combined Charging System) ports will also be made compatible with the NACS system via an adapter. This will allow a smoother transition for owners of existing Japanese factory vehicles who wish to use the infrastructure of Elon Musk's company.
In addition to adopting the NACS standard, Honda is already involved in a joint venture with other automakers, including BMW, GM, Kya, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, to develop a high-voltage charging network across North America. However, the implementation of NACS will mean that Honda customers will be able to use Tesla Superchargers in the future, further expanding the charging options available.
