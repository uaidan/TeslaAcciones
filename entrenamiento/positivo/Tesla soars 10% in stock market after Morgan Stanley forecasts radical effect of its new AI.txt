Tesla jumped 10.09% Monday after Morgan Stanley said its Dojo supercomputer could generate a $600 billion increase in the electric carmaker's market value by accelerating its foray into robotaxis and software services.
Tesla, already the world's most valuable automaker, began production of the supercomputer to train artificial intelligence models for autonomous cars in July, and plans to invest more than $1 billion in Dojo through next year.
Dojo can open up new markets that "go well beyond selling vehicles at a fixed price," say Morgan Stanley analysts led by Alex Jonas.
If Dojo can help cars see and react, what other markets could open up? Think of any cutting-edge device with a camera that makes real-time decisions based on its field of view."
The investment bank has upgraded its recommendation for Tesla shares to "overweight" from "hold," and substituted U.S.-listed Ferrari shares for Tesla as a "favorite pick."
Morgan Stanley thus raises its 12-18 month target for Tesla shares by 60% to $400, the highest among Wall Street agencies, according to LSEG data. That would give the automaker a value of $1.39 billion. That figure is 76% higher than Tesla's market value of about $789 billion, according to Friday's close, at $248.5 per share.
The bank raises its revenue estimate for Tesla's network services business to $335 billion in 2040 from $157 billion previously. Analysts expect the unit to account for more than 60% of Tesla's profits in 2040, nearly double that in 2030. "This increase will be driven largely by the emerging opportunity we see in third-party fleet licensing," the analyst says.
Tesla's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 57.9 is well ahead of those of Ford (6.31) and General Motors (4.56), according to LSEG data.
